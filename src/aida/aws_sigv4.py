"""AWS Signature Version 4 request signing, over the standard library alone.

**Invariant this module exists to hold:** a signed request is a pure
function of the request and the credential, and that function is pinned to
AWS's own published test vectors. Nothing here talks to a network, holds
state, or logs -- so the only way it can be wrong is a way a known-answer
test can catch.

Why hand-rolled rather than an SDK: `boto3` is not a dependency of this
project and adding one to sign four S3 requests would pull a transitive
tree into the SDK/packaging story for no capability this module cannot
supply. SigV4 is fully specified and small; the risk of writing it is not
that it is hard but that it is *silently* wrong, and the answer to that is
`tests/test_aws_sigv4.py`, which checks this implementation against the
canonical-request, string-to-sign and signature values AWS publishes for
its own worked examples.

Scope, deliberately narrow: header-based (`Authorization`) signing of a
single-chunk payload, the only form `aida.audit_archive_storage`'s S3
provider issues. No presigned URLs, no chunked/streaming signatures, no
STS session-token refresh (a `session_token` is signed if one is supplied,
but obtaining one is out of scope).

The secret key appears in exactly one place -- the local `signing_key`
derivation -- and is never logged, never returned, and never embedded in
the `Authorization` header, which carries only the access key id, the
scope and the resulting signature.
